            <h1>Ai Introduction</h1>
            <centre>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that allows machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI uses algorithms, data, and computational power to learn, reason, and solve problems. 
How does AI work? 
AI collects data from various sources.
AI sorts and analyzes the data using patterns it has been programmed to learn.
AI uses these patterns to predict outcomes.
If the data sets are considered a “fail,” AI learns from that mistake, and the process is repeated again.
AI applications
Optical character recognition (OCR): Uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents 
Voice assistants: Like Siri and Alexa 
Customer service chatbots: Help you navigate websites 
Self-driving cars: Act independently, replacing the need for human intelligence or intervention 
Oncology: AI systems have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting early-stage cancers 
AI as a field
AI is a multidisciplinary domain that draws upon a variety of techniques, algorithms, and methodologies.
