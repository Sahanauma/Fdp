            <centre>Data mining is the process of analyzing large amounts of data to find patterns and insights. The goal is to discover useful information that can be used to improve sales, marketing, manufacturing, and more. 
How does data mining work?
Data preparation: Raw data from different sources is converted into a standard format. This includes removing errors, finding missing values, and removing duplicates. 
Analysis: Mathematical analysis, machine learning, and statistics are used to discover patterns and trends in the data. 
Interpretation: The patterns and trends are used to derive actionable insights. 
Data mining techniques: 
Regression analysis: Predicts the value of a feature based on the values of other features
Association rule discovery: Uncovers relationships between variables in a data set
Classification: Groups data into categories
Clustering: Groups data into clusters based on similarities
Data mining applications: market research, improving sales and marketing, optimizing manufacturing, detecting fraud, and enhancing security. </centre>
